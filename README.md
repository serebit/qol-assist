Quality of Life assistant for rolling release Linux distributions (i.e. Solus).

During the lifetime of a rolling release Linux distribution, new problems occur that are often
complex to deal with. An example would be udev rules requiring the addition of new UNIX user groups
by udev rules (`setfacl`) - and the requirement to automatically migrate active users to those
groups.

Traditionally post-install packaging scripts have no knowledge of users, so `qol-assist`
will bridge that gap by being a central location for rolling QoL operations to continue
providing a solid user experience whilst still being able to make deep changes to the OS.

**Note**: This is a brand-new project and is currently being built for a very specific Solus
need, but it will grow in time to be an agnostic project suitable outside of Solus.

`qol-assist` is a [Solus project.](https://getsol.us/)
